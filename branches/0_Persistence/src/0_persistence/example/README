This package consists essentially of header files that can be used in
your own implementation. For demonstration purposes, it also contains
two wrappers, main.C and main_w_density.C, which generate command-line
based clustering programs (see the Running section for details on how
to use them).


---------------
Compiling the code:

It is strongly recommended to use the g++ compiler, version >=
4.2. Before compiling, you need to install and compile the ANN
library, which is available from http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/.

To compile, edit the Makefile and change the path to the ANN
library. Make sure you compile it first so the compiler can find the
header files and linking library. Then, type make to build the two
programs: main and main_w_density.

All other dependencies are on standard STL classes and will compile
with recent g++ distributions.


---------------
Running the code:

Running ./main without any arguments simply outputs the list of
required arguments:

- the input file is assumed to be in ASCII format and to have the
following structure:

coordinates function_value
coordinates function_value
coordinates function_value
coordinates function_value
	    :
	    :
	    :

where the coordinates of each point are given in the form x_1 x_2 ... x_d. 

- the second argument is the radius delta (a.k.a. Rips radius) to be used
  in the construction of the neighborhood (Rips) graph.

- the third argument is the threshold tau on the prominence of the
  clusters to be used for merging clusters. It also serves as a
  threshold on the heights of the peaks, so any cluster of height less
  than tau is treated as background noise.

- the fourth argument is the name of the COFF file in which the
  clusters will be output for visualization. It can be opened with
  Geomview or any 3d viewer that supports OFF files with color
  information.


* Output:

The clusters are output in the file clusters.txt. Line i in this file
corresponds to the same data point as line i in the input file. Each
line contains a single integer: the id of the cluster to which the
corresponding data point belongs, or NaN if the data point has been
treated as background noise by the algorithm. The clusters are
numbered from 1 to some value k (depending on the choice of tau).

The persistence diagram is output in a file named diagram.txt. Each
line gives the coordinates of a diagram point. Such data can be
visualized e.g. in Matlab by running the script display_diagram
provided in the utils/ subdirectory of this archive.  
-------------- Important notice: the persistence diagram will be
correct only if parameter tau is set to some value higher than
the maximum of the density over the point cloud (in practice, you can
typically take 1e20). If you choose a smaller value for tau, then
some clusters will not be merged whereas they should be, and therefore
the corresponding points in the persistence diagram will be projected
down onto the horizontal line y=-infty. --------------

For ease of visualization, the clusters are also output
color-coded in the file clusters_3d.coff. Only the first 3 coordinates
are kept per point. Such a file can be visualized in software such as
Geomview or MeshLab. Each cluster is assigned a random color, black
meaning background noise.


* Example: 

On the toy data set, you can start with the following command:

./main inputs/toy_example_w_density.txt 0.25 1e20

which runs the program with delta=0.25 and tau=1e20. You can then
visualize the persistence diagram encoded in diagram.txt by typing the
following commands in Matlab:

load 'diagram'; 
display_diagram(diagram);

The script display_diagram can take a prominence threshold tau as
additional argument. For instance,

display_diagram(diagram, 1e3);

It then shows the thresholding line superimposed to the persistence
diagram. This may help users find relevant values for tau. Once
this step is done, you can rerun the clustering program with the
chosen value of tau (e.g. 1.3):

./main inputs/toy_example_w_density.txt 0.25 1e3

and visulalize the corresponding clustering in clusters_3d.coff. You
can also load inputs/toy_examples_w_density.txt and clusters.txt in
Matlab and use the command 'scatter' to visualize the result. In this
example, the choice of tau reduces the number of clusters to 6.

Finally, you can compare your result with the one obtained by the 1976
paper by Koontz et al. by rerunning the program with tau=0:

./main inputs/toy_example_w_density.txt 0.25 0


* Other examples:

./main inputs/spiral_w_density.txt 10 1e-3

-> gives 2 spiral-shaped clusters separated from the background noise 


./main inputs/spiral_w_density.txt 25 1e-3

-> gives 2 clusters spanning the entire data set (no background noise)


./main inputs/4_rings_w_density.txt 1 0.25 

-> gives 4 ring-shaped clusters spanning the whole data set 


* Data sets without density information:

If you have a point cloud without any density information attached
to it, you can use ./main_w_density, which first estimates the density
at each data point using the (inverse of the) distance to a measure,
and then runs the same clustering code as ./main. There is one
additional parameter to be tuned: the number k of neighbors to use when
computing the distance to a measure. The rest of the arguments are the
same as above.

For instance, on the same example as above you may run the density
estimator with k=200:

./main_w_density inputs/toy_example_w_o_density.txt 200 0.25 1e20

You can then visualize the diagram in Matlab and find that choosing
tau=2 should give the correct number of clusters. Afterwards, you can
re-run the clustering with the new threshold:

./main_w_density inputs/toy_example_w_o_density.txt 200 0.25 2

The resulting 6 clusters are output in clusters.txt and clusters_3d.coff.

Note that in the file include/Density.h you can find other density
estimators (ball, Gaussian) for you to use instead of the (inverse)
distance to a measure in main_with_density.


---------------
Known bugs and limitations:

* This implementation does not follow the prescriptions of the paper
  in that the information regarding the roots of the clusters is
  encoded directly in the union-find data structure, not in a separate
  container. As a result, long paths may appear in the disjoint-set
  forest, thus yielding a O(nm) worst-case running time in theory, where n and
  m are respectively the number of vertices and number of edges of the
  neighorhood graph. Note however that the running time remains reasonable in
  practice, where the clustering procedure turns out to run much
  faster than the neighborhood graph construction anyway.


---------------
Code structure:

The core of the algorithm is implemented in Core.h.  It is templated by
three classes: an iterator class, a distance class, and a cluster
class. 

* The iterator class is simply the iterator on the container of the
data points (represented by instances of the Vertex class). The
container must be able to return such an iterator through the
get_sink() and set_sink() methods. In addition, for purely technical
reasons the current implementation templates the Vertex class by the
container that holds it.

* The distance class is here mostly for computing the neighborhood graph:
 in spirit it contains all the metric information.

* The clustering class is here for setting the parameters of the
algorithm. It is templated by the distance class because we may want
to divide by the distance when computing the pseudo-gradient.

In these cases it should be noted that the vertex class contains the
geometry for each point as well as additional cluster information used
by the cluster class. This way, this information as well as the
function value is directly associated with the point.

As a rule of thumb, the prototypes of the functions that must be
provided are listed in Cluster.h and Distance.h. The only two
functions the point cloud class must provide to the algorithm are
get_sink() and set_sink(), which return an iterator of the appropriate
type.
